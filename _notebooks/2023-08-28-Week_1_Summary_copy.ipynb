    "On Monday, me and my partner Sathvik began the day by installing the nessasary tools fo the course. A few of the tools included, docker, anaconda, vscode, slack etc. At one step, namely ***make*** both of use could not progress further as we faced the same error ***error1***. This little error stopped us from moving further. We tried a lot of things but none of it seemed to work the make command. Finally chatgpt helped out solving the problem with the two commands."
